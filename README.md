Convert Solar Soft X-ray Light into MIDI -> Music

# Requirements
* Install [this python midi library](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi). Written in python 2, so you may need to set up a custom environment if you don't have one already. I needed to. 
* The [MinXSS level 1 data](http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/minxss/data/level-1/). Make sure to update the path in the Jupyter notebook to point to wherever you save the data file.
* See the top of the Jupyter notebook for import statements for other (much more standard) packages you may need. 

# Description
Basically, just run the Jupyter notebook and you'll get a midi file out. Tweak the code however you like to change the results. 
Then, use whatever music software you prefer to import the midi file and play with instruments, mix, effects, etc. I prefer Logic Pro X and have included that project file here as well. I also use a couple instruments from the East West Quantum Leap Symphony Orchestra, but you can replace those with whatever you like.
